I’ll be very honest up front, because this matters:

> **True “passive” income almost never comes fast.**
> What *can* come fast is **time-leveraged income**—you work hard once on a PC,
> then earnings can continue with much less effort.

Given your constraints:

* ✅ Only **time + PC**
* ⏱️ **Limited time**, needs income *soon*
* ❌ No upfront money

Here are the **most realistic options**, ranked from **fastest potential payoff → slower but more passive**.

---

## 1. Digital Products (Fastest realistic path)

**Effort-heavy upfront, scalable afterward**

### What works best:

* **Simple PDFs** (guides, checklists, planners)
* **Templates** (Notion, Google Docs, Excel)
* **Short educational content** (cheat sheets, summaries)

### Why this works:

* Create once → sell unlimited times
* No inventory, no shipping
* Can start selling within **days**

### Examples:

* “Beginner’s guide to ___”
* Study planners
* Workout planners
* Resume templates
* Budget trackers

### Where to sell:

* Gumroad
* Etsy (digital downloads)
* Ko-fi

⏱️ Time to first income: **3–14 days**
🧠 Skill required: **basic writing + clarity**

---

## 2. YouTube (Semi-passive, but slow ramp)

**Best long-term option if you can be consistent**

### Works if:

* You pick a **narrow topic**
* Videos are searchable (tutorials, explanations)

### Good niches:

* “How to use ___”
* Simple explainers
* Study techniques
* Software walkthroughs
* Short-form (YouTube Shorts)

### Monetization:

* Ads (later)
* Affiliate links
* Digital products (combine with #1)

⏱️ Time to income: **1–3 months (minimum)**
📈 Long-term upside: **Very high**

---

## 3. Affiliate Content (Fast if done right)

**Not fully passive, but scalable**

### How:

* Write reviews or comparisons
* Make short videos
* Post on blogs, Reddit, YouTube, TikTok

### Works best for:

* Software
* Online tools
* Learning platforms
* Subscriptions

⚠️ Important:

* Don’t spam
* Be honest and helpful

⏱️ Time to income: **2–6 weeks**
💡 Best paired with YouTube or blogs

---

## 4. AI-Assisted Microproducts (High leverage)

**Use your PC + tools to work faster**

Examples:

* Prompt packs
* AI-generated planners (edited by you)
* AI-assisted ebooks (human-reviewed!)

⚠️ Warning:
Low-effort AI spam does **not** sell.
But **curated + practical** content does.

⏱️ Time to income: **1–2 weeks** if done well

---

## 5. Print-on-Demand (Low upfront, slower)

**Less passive than it looks**

You design:

* T-shirts
* Posters
* Stickers

Platforms:

* Redbubble
* Printify + Etsy

⏱️ Time to income: **weeks–months**
🎯 Works best with niche humor or trends

---

## What I Would NOT Recommend (Given Your Constraints)

❌ Dropshipping (too slow, risky)
❌ Stock trading / crypto (not passive, risky)
❌ Surveys / click farms (waste of time)
❌ “Get rich fast” schemes (don’t work)

## Best Strategy If You Need Income Fast

**Combine two things:**

1. **Create ONE digital product**
2. **Promote it via short content (YouTube Shorts / TikTok / Reddit)**

This gives:

* Speed
* Scalability
* Potential for passive income later

---

## If you want, I can:

* Help you **pick the best niche** based on what you already know
* Outline a **digital product you can create in a weekend**
* Show a **step-by-step 7-day plan** to your first sale

Just tell me:
**What are you already good at or interested in?**
