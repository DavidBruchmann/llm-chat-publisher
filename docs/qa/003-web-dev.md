Good choice—and I’ll be direct: **web dev is your highest-probability option**
given your constraints *and* your need for speed.

You don’t need to switch topics. You need to **aim at the right layer of web dev**,
where credentials matter least and clarity matters most.

---

## Why Web Dev Beats the Other Topics *for You*

### Compared to math

* Math buyers expect rigor and references
* Harder to market without formal framing
* Longer trust-building phase

### Compared to social/environmental topics

* Highly saturated
* Credibility and sourcing matter more
* Monetization is slower unless you already have an audience

### Web dev advantages

✅ You already earn money here → implicit credibility
✅ Huge beginner audience
✅ Constant confusion = constant demand
✅ Practical explanations sell
✅ Buyers care about *understanding*, not degrees

So yes: **stay with web dev**.

## The Exact Positioning You Should Use

You should **not** position yourself as:

> “Expert web developer”

You *should* position yourself as:

> **“A working web developer explaining things the way he wished they were explained.”**

This removes the need for:

* Academic references
* Formal authority
* “Best practices” policing

---

## The Highest-Conversion Web Dev Angles (Low Competition)

These are proven to sell *fast*.

### 1. Mental Models (Your best fit)

Examples:

* “What actually happens when you load a webpage”
* “Frontend vs backend without buzzwords”
* “Why CSS feels broken (and isn’t)”
* “How JavaScript really runs in the browser”

People **pay** for mental clarity.

---

### 2. Debugging & Problem-Solving Logs

Your “fiddling” becomes an asset.

Examples:

* “I broke my layout for 3 hours—here’s why”
* “One tiny JS mistake that cost me a day”
* “Understanding async by failing at it”

These are:

* Relatable
* Trust-building
* Easy to produce

---

### 3. Transition Guides (Very High Demand)

Examples:

* “From HTML/CSS to ‘real’ web dev”
* “Why tutorials stop working after a while”
* “What junior devs aren’t told”

These sell well because they hit **frustration points**.

## The Single Best Product You Could Build (Fast)

### 📘 Product Concept

**Title (example):**

> *“Web Development Without the Fog: Mental Models That Finally Make Things Click”*

### Scope

* 30–40 pages
* No frameworks
* No hype
* No references needed

### Chapters (example)

1. What a browser actually does
2. Why HTML is not “structure” the way people say
3. CSS as constraint solving (not styling)
4. JavaScript as coordination, not logic
5. Why frameworks exist (and why beginners hate them)
6. Common misunderstandings that slow you down

This is **gold** for beginners.

---

## Why This Can Work *Fast*

* Beginners actively search for clarity
* You already speak their language
* You don’t need a large audience
* You can sell at €10–€19 easily

Just **10 sales/day** = real income.

---

## How to Handle Credibility (Important)

Add a short disclaimer like:

> “This guide is written from the perspective of a working web developer.
> It focuses on practical understanding, not formal computer science definitions.”

That’s it. No more anxiety.

---

## 7-Day Execution Plan (Realistic)

**Day 1** – Outline chapters
**Day 2–4** – Write (don’t polish yet)
**Day 5** – Add diagrams (very simple)
**Day 6** – Set up Gumroad page
**Day 7** – Post 3–5 explanations publicly

Platforms to post:

* Reddit (webdev, learnprogramming)
* Dev.to
* Medium
* YouTube Shorts (optional)

---

## Brutal Truth (But Encouraging)

Most web dev content is:

* Over-engineered
* Over-confident
* Badly explained

Clear, humble explanations from someone who *actually builds things* stand out immediately.

---

If you want, next I can:

* Help you **nail the exact title + promise**
* Create a **detailed chapter outline**
* Draft your **Gumroad sales page**
* Or help you **validate demand before writing**

Just tell me what you want to do next.
